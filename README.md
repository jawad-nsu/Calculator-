# Calculator-


It was part of the CSE215 (Object Oriented Programming) course. It was a GUI application based on the MVC design pattern.

  1. MainFx - this is the fxml file generated by using the scene builder in JavaFx - our view class
  2. MainController - this is our controller file, I bound this class with the fxml file as it's controller class
  3. Model - this is our model class, it was used to make the core operation of the project, an object was made of this class
     and the calculate method was called from our controller class with the provided user's argument and in turn it returns the 
     the calculation result.

What do you need if you want to run these files on your local machine?

1. Download javaFx
2. If you still can't seem to run then download the .jar file
3. Make sure to dowload scene builder as well, if you want to do some changes on your own.
4. Enjoy
